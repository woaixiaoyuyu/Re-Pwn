# PWN
Quoting a quote from a blogger<br>
Pwn is an art.<br>
Pwn is a romantic dance with another programmer’s mind and thought.<br>
U even have never seen each other,but ur thought collision occurs here in such a romantic way.<br>
Pwn is a romantic dance on the stage of CPU & Memory.<br>
It’s like to be an ancient Necromancer,doing the thing overflow the ordinary mind.<br><br>
